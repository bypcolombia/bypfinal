Possibly with the banner phrase that announces our change of logo and unification of the web, some people may think: The world evolves? We do too? How can there be evolution at times like these when people die from COVID-19, when we are in quarantine, when there are massive layoffs, when the economy is weakening, when the people is in shock; my idea today isn´t to say every single thing to be solved from this experience; On the opposite, my goal is that we can see all the opportunities in this situation and send strength, peace and hope to your hearts in this moment full of challenges.

My invitation is to keep you and those in your care safe; Fortunately in Colombia, there has been help for people, they have given markets, there have been bank reliefs, in taxes, among others; Is it difficult? Well, it depends on where we look at it and how much we give of ourselves in every situation that comes to us in life, you, who are reading this, you are not the only one who is living in isolation and facing difficulties, there are millions of people in all the world in this situation, so what is the use of spending your energy complaining, what is the use of fighting, is useless, or works only to lower your energy and victimize yourself; people die? Yes, every day, from various causes, we now have a greater threat and it is this virus, especially since there are many people in cities, so there is a greater risk of contagion; I invite you, not only to stay safe, to take care of yourself, to try not to catch the virus and if you do not pass it on to others.

Look for your physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual tools, everything that works for you and makes you act like a human being, who solves, who looks how to get ahead, who seeks to stay calm and apply that saying that: “if life gives you lemons, you make lemonade”; Along these lines, I present to you what, in my opinion, are opportunities from this experience; you can enlarge the list, focus on the positive, work on the improvement aspects and move forward

* Now, Work at Home is a reality for many
* The value of TIC’s (Technologies, Information and Communications) for humanity has been revealed, regarding work, family and personal communication, leisure, information; we must continue advancing in Technology that helps humanity, the planet, the use and proper administration of all resources; everything within ethics
* It has revealed the need to change the way we use transportation, it is important that especially in cities, unnecessary movements are reduced, meaning that we try to move consciously and that those who need to travel for their jobs, in which they need them In person, they are the ones who mobilize and that our trips for pleasure are made with awareness
* The environment has improved significantly (Nature), it would be healthy for the habitants of cities and urban centers to stop and isolate themselves at least a couple of days a month, or a couple of weeks a year and leave nature free; however, it is important, once we resolve the situation by COVID-19 which is the priority, from now on, for those who can, let us continue working on improving the environment, strengthening recycling, working on rebuilding the soil
* This situation gives us the opportunity to do our own stuff, be at home, train yourselves in the fulfillment of agreements
* It is an opportunity for urban planning to be reviewed from now on, the way we live in cities, it´s time to think about taking more advantage of the land, there is room for everyone if we know how to use the space, so that we can live in larger spaces, with more contact with the earth, but also distance and personal space
* It is also giving us the opportunity to review our skills for living with others and with ourselves if we are alone.
* To review and strengthen our emotional and spiritual deficiencies
* To effectively manage our time
* To slow down and rest
* To be clean and tidy
* For unity, be empathetic and caring
* It is an opportunity to test our strength and courage in the situations that life presents us, in the face of uncertainty
* It is also an opportunity to value the people who really care about you.

Life will move forward with or without us, while we are here we should make this experience valuable, because now, tomorrow or later, either for this virus or for any other reason, the only sure thing is that we will die, let everything that comes can helps us be better human beings.
